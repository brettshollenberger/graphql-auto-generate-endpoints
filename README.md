# Egghead Starter App

This application serves as a starting point for lots of my Egghead courses because it's a simple implementation of many modern web technologies.

# What's in the box?

A modern full-stack framework intended to help you focus on the frontend part of learning to program:
* Frontend:
  * React (for UI)
  * Redux (for state management)
  * react-scripts (for all the build processes you don't want to worry about -- webpack, babel, etc)
  * Redux Saga (for side-effect management)
* Backend:
  * json-server (Manages all the nitty gritty of an API for us)

# Plus, all you have to do to get started is:

```bash
npm install
bundle install
foreman start
```
